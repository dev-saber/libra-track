# Libra Track

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Project Overview

Libra Track is a C++ application designed to efficiently manage a library's operations, providing a user-friendly interface for library staff and patrons. This system offers a comprehensive set of features for tracking books, users, and their interactions.

# üë®‚Äçüíª Technology Stack & Packages

Libra Track is coded with C++, the only programming language used to develop the core of the application. Here are some libraries used to reach the objectives of the project:

| Libraries | Utility |
| --- | --- |
| iostream | Standard input/output functionalities |
| vector | Dynamically resizable arrays, offering efficient memory management. |
| algorithm | Set of algorithms and functions for searching, sorting, transforming, and more. |
| optional | Representing an optional value that allows safe and expressive handling of potential absence of value. |
| ctime | Defines functions and types related to time and date. |
| chrono | Provides advanced features for measuring time and durations. |
| thread | Enables concurrent task execution to improve performance or responsiveness. |
